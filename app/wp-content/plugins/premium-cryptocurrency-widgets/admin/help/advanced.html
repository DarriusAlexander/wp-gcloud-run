<h3>Auto coin recognition</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes, when you have multiple pages or posts, each providing information about a particular coin, it can be
    useful that coin and currency symbols are obtained from the page URL rather than each individual widget shortcode. This way you
    can have exactly the same shortcodes across all such pages, but they will display quotes depending on coin and currency
    are passed in the page URL.
    To set this up you need to fill in the <b>Asset recognition regexp</b> setting, which should be a valid regular
    expression with 2 groups to capture coin and display currency symbol respectively.
</p>
<p>
    Let's consider an example. Suppose, you have 3 pages with the following URLs: coin-page-btc-usd, coin-page-eth-eur,
    coin-page-xrp-usd.
    In this case you can specify the following regular expression in the <b>Asset recognition regexp</b> setting:
    <pre><code>^coin-page-([a-zA-Z0-9-\*]+)-([a-zA-Z0-9-\*]+)/?$</code></pre>
    After that when one of these pages is accessed the plugin will retrieve coin symbol and currency from the URL and display corresponding quotes,
    irrespective of what is specified in the <b>assets</b> parameter of the shortcode.
</p>
<p>
    Please note, that all multi-coin widgets (such as table widgets, for instance) on such pages will also be overridden to use
    coin and display currency provided in the URL.
</p>

<h3>Virtual coin pages</h3>
<p>
    When you want to have a dedicated page for every coin it can be cumbersome to manually create a lot of coin pages.
    Don't worry, you can have the plugin auto generate and display such pages automatically on demand.
    You need to specify a regular expression in the <b>Virtual asset page regexp</b> setting.
    When a visitor requests a page, which URL matches this expression a virtual page will be automatically created and displayed to the visitor.
    The content of such pages will be generated based on the <b>Virtual asset page content</b> setting. There you can
    insert any number of cryptocurrency widgets (as well as some static text), but the plugin will automatically substitute the necessary coin and display currency from the URL.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose, that you want the plugin to auto generate a coin page when the following URLs are requested:
    https://yourwebsite.com/crypto/btc/usd, https://yourwebsite.com/crypto/eth/usd, https://yourwebsite.com/crypto/xrp/usd etc.
    In this case you can specify the following regular expression in the <b>Virtual asset page regexp</b> setting:
    <pre><code>^crypto/([a-zA-Z0-9-\*]+)/([a-zA-Z0-9-\*]+)/?$</code></pre>
    You can add this widget to the <b>Virtual asset page content</b> setting:
    <pre><code>[cryptocurrency_widget type="card" template="basic3" color="blue" assets="BTC~USD" api="cryptocompare.com" realtime="true" flash="true"]</code></pre>
    After that, when user opens https://yourwebsite.com/crypto/eth/usd the plugin will display an auto-generated page with Ethereum / USD widget on it
    (in this case it doesn't matter which asset is specified in the widget shortcode). Of course, you can have as many widgets on
    the auto generated pages as you like.
</p>
<p>
    Please note, that all multi-coin widgets (such as table widgets, for instance) on virtual coin pages
    will not inherit coin and display currency from the URL, but will use those from the shortcode.
</p>
<p>
    The main difference between <b>Auto coin recognition</b> and <b>Virtual coin pages</b> features is that the former is suitable
    for <b>existing</b> pages or posts and the latter is used to handle requests to <b>non-existing</b> (virtual) pages.
